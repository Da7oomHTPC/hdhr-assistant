| Channel information that comes from Zap2It is typically the 3-5 letter
| station call sign. To prettify the name, you can set the channel name
| here.
|
| The first variable should be the channel number followed by the call sign
| with a space seperating the two. This is done to prevent false channel
| names from overwriting actual ones in the case that your cable provider
| changes channel numbers or names.
|
| IMPORTANT! Make sure you rename this file to `channels.php` to activate it!
