|
| Cable and satellite providers typically have a series of channels which
| it considers radio channels. These channels simply play music, often
| times with static slideshow images on the screen.
|
| Kodi's Live TV functionality has a specifc area just for radio stations.
| Here you can define what channel numbers are those radio stations and
| what the name of the station is.
|
| IMPORTANT! Make sure you rename this file to `radio.php` to activate it!
